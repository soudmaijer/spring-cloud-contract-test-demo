## Spring Cloud Contract example application

This application demonstrates how to use Spring Cloud Contract for different purposes:

* Defining contracts for APIs
* Verifying the API implementation against the defined contract
* Generating stubs for consumers (clients) of an API
* Using a stub server during consumer (client) tests
* Using a stub server while running a client locally (not using the real service implementation)
